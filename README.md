**MOBILE APPLICATION FOR THE VISUALLY IMAPRED PERSONS**

The world for normal human being is far different than visually impaired, due to either lack of vision or no vision. The difficulties in their daily routines can be minimized with help of technological support which is usually aids that can be used for travelling. Computer vision a field of artificial intelligence provides the assistance for helping impaired. Information that peoples collect from their surroundings and the outside world is obtained through sight. visually impaired people suffer inconveniences in their daily and social life because of lack of sight. losing sight is one of the most unfortunate things that can happen to someone.

**PROBLEM**

- Unsafe Navigation through the environment.
- CDifficulty in communicating with people in other locations.
- Difficulty in reading and writing for the visually impaired people.

**TARGET GROUP**

Partially blind and completely blind individuals

**SOLUTION**

A mobile-based app which has integrations with a variety of technologies like voice recognition software, image processing, and voice commands.(NLP).
The application will have three core features namely
- Facetime like module/feature. 

The user will have all the important contacts mostly relatives on the app were the user will navigate the app through voice commands that are taken in as input to navigate to specific areas on the app. The app will use a screen reader / app assistant to take the user through he contact list and help then choose who  they want to call.

On selection, the call will be made and the person called will be able to take the blind person through their daily environment inform of directions.  The app will be connected to glasses where the person called will view directly through the glasses. connected to the glasses will be a camera for livestreaming.

**Text to Speech Feature**

This will also use the camera which will be connected to the phone via glasses, on initializing the camera we shall use NLP Algorithms to process data that in in front of the visually impaired personnel. This data letâ€™s say text will be read out loud for the person.

**Speech to text feature**

This feature will use NLP algorithms for speech to Text. Cases where this will be used are
Sending message to relatives (communication with people far away).
Once again this will be connected to the contact list on the app where the app assistant will help the user accomplish the specified task.
The user will select the contact to sent a message to. This can be through voice message or a text that is converted from speech by these algorithms.

NB : **App navigation will be through an App assistant, like the way SIRI works.**

1.	The user can use the system offline since it will work both online and offline.
2.	Due to the interactive nature of the app, users will have an interest in voice commands for direct feedback and get instructions in Realtime.
3.	Due to the video chat help, people will get employed in companies that will get registered to give full-time help to the blind users of the system hence eradicating unemployment among the youths.

**OBJECTIVES**

The general objective of the suggested system for visually impaired people using voice recognition and image processing system is to
- make blind people more independent and become aware of their surroundings easily
- Designing the compact size device that works on real time for visually impaired.
- Cost effective system for understanding scene that will help the visually imparted navigate. Or in their daily lives.
